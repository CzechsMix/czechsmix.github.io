##### I'm trying to get better at getting better.

I try to spend quite of bit of time building a sound body, a sound mind and achieving goals I set for myself. Such is the main content of my blog, but all work and no play makes Sam a dull boy. So, when I'm relaxing I enjoy spending time with friends, the brewing, *and drinking* of craft beer, and nearly all manner of video and board games.
