Shortly before my wedding, I decided that I would make a 4th attempt at losing my excess weight, and getting in shape. I was over 230 pounds, which is obese for my height. After my most recent attempt to outrun a bad fork, I decided to bite the bullet and keep a food log. So here's what I looked like when I started.

And here's what I look like at the time of writing.

#### So how'd I do it?

Well, let's begin with how *long*. These photos are taken, just 4 days shy of 1 year apart. If that sounds alarm bells in your head, Then maybe this isn't the blog for you. If you're looking to shed some pounds quick, I can't help you. Okay, I can, but I don't believe in dispensing advice that would ultimately harm your health, not help it. If you want some *too good to be true* weight loss plan, check with Dr. Oz. I don't get paid enough to sell out.
