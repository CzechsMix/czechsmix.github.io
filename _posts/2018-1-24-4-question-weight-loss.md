## And What You Should Ask Instead

# What are some delicious low calorie meals?

### Ask Instead

What are some filling low calorie meals?

### Why?

Hear me out on this. IMO, food should not be thought of as a source of pleasure. Your body only needs food for fuel. So eat for fuel. I **am not** saying it's wrong to eat good tasting food, I'm saying it's going to be very difficult to focus on losing weight, if "tastes good" is your top priority.

Losing weight is tough enough as it is. Why make it more difficult by spending hours a week scrolling through pinterest, planning meals, and spending a lot of money on special foods like brown sugar substitutes, and extra lean beef? When all is said and done, it's easier to eat low calorie food that just doesn't taste bad. Aside from weight loss, the discipline you build will pay itself back many times over. If you want a metric to judge your meals by, use filling. Food that will help you lose weight is calorie rare \[sic\], filling, and takes a while to eat. *cough cough high fiber vegetables cough cough*.

# What is the best exercise for burning calories?

### Ask Instead

What exercises or physical activity do I enjoy doing?

### Why?

Exercise is fantastic and I highly recommend you do it for a number of reasons, just not for weight loss. So find some physical activity you enjoy (or at least can commit to) and do it on a regular basis. For weight loss focusing your efforts on eating less instead of moving more will yield greater results. 

> You get fit at the gym, but you lose weight in the kitchen.

Exercise also makes you hungry (with the possible exception of HIIT, but [the science](http://www.the-aps.org/mm/hp/Audiences/Public-Press/Archive/08/40.html) is limited, one study with N=11). After workout shakes and bars are notorious for packing in as many or more calories than normal shakes and candy bars. Some gyms even give out free pizza! Nothing against pizza by itself, but because of ego depletion, if you hit the gym after a hard days work, and you just put in 20-40 minutes of high intensity exercise, your willpower will be at it's weakest point all day. Are you sure you'd be able to say no? Never underestimate the supply of people who will pressure you. Because after all "You've earned it." 

# How can I boost my metabolism?

### Ask Instead

What is my TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)

### Why?

This is an interesting question to ask in the first place, because most of the time people ask me this, they don't even know what they're current base metabolic rate is (The number of calories you burn just being a living, breathing person). Metabolic rate varies wildly with respect to age, height, weight, and sex. Aside from those factors, it's fairly consistent. Sure I've heard some things work: Green Tea, High Carb Low Fat Vegan, Keto... At the end of the day however, I'm not aware of any *evidence based* methods to gain a significant metabolic advantage. Since you can't get younger, grow taller, or change your chromosomes, The best advice here is to understand what your metabolic rate is, and focus on diet and lifestyle choices that work within that number.

# How far/long do I have to run to burn off this tasty treat?

### Ask Instead

Do I really need or even want this? How long will the pleasure of eating it really last?

### Why? 

It is, **BY FAR**, easier to just not indulge in the first place. Checking the math, it might seem worth it at first. To run off say, a small cookie dough blizzard from dairy queen (420 kcal), you just need to run a 3 miles at a 10 min mile pace. Maybe that doesn't seem so bad to you.

But what if you couldn't eat it on credit? You know, go ahead and eat the blizzard and just tell yourself you're *going to run later...maybe...when you "find" the time. *Imagine you had to run 3 miles before you could go to Dairy Queen. Would you still do it? Oh and that just breaks you even, it doesn't help you lose weight.

There's the time commitment to consider as well. Get dressed, possibly drive to the gym and back, shower, probably sit on the couch and flip through your phone a bit while you "take a breather"? Again, exercise is fantastic for you, and I highly recommend you make time for an appropriate amount of exercise, but it's just not an effective tool for allowing you to indulge in calorie dense food.
