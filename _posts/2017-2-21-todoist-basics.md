tags: productivity

Do you ever feel like there is too much to do and not enough time? Do you ever feel like there is something you should be doing, but don't know what? Or maybe you know everything you need to do and just feel to over whelmed to start? Well then...

#### Why Todoist?

I want to quickly come of the features that make Todoist a top-notch productivity app. Todoist stands out by excelling in 3 categories

1. It's Powerful

  Todoist has all the major features you need. Tasks can *deep breath* be sorted into projects (which can be nested in other projects), they can be nested under other tasks, have built in priority support, due dates (with or without a due time), they can recur and even be shared with others. And that's just the free features!

2. It's Flexible

  Todoist gives you the power to implement a number of specific workflows, but doesn't tie you down to any of them. More than just using Todoist to organize your day to day tasks, you can organize your grocery list, home and automobile maintenance schedule. I've even got a recurring task reminding me buy a new toothbrush

3. It's Everywhere

  I mean *everywhere*. Windows? Yup. OSX? You bet. Android and iOS? Of course! it has apps for popular web browsers and even extensions in for both outlook and Gmail. Go off the grid? No problem, Todoist can keep track of your progress and sync itself when you get an internet connection.  

  Accessibility doesn't stop at devices it can run on. The application supports 18 languages!

#### What comes with Premium

Todoist offers several advanced features at a cost. While the free version is a more than adequate tool in it's own right, many customers (myself included) find the premium juice is more than worth the squeeze. For what boils down to a few dollars a month, Todoist Premium includes comments and file attachments on tasks, unlimited reminders (including location based), automatic backups, tasks labels and customs filters (which, when combined, can lead to a seriously effective, yet lean experience), and more.

#### Todoist Core Concepts

1. The Task

  The fundamental building block of Todoist is the Task. A task is an action to be completed. It can be a real task like brushing your teeth or walking the dog, or it can represent other items, like something on your grocery list.

2. The Project

3. The Inbox

  Every todoist account includes an Inbox. This functions for the most part, as any other Todoist Project.
