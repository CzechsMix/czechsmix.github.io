title: Is Shakeology worth it?

Pushed hard by beachbody coaches everywhere, I take a look at this fitness supplement to find out if it measures up to the hype.

#### What is ShakeologyÂ®?

Their [website](http://www.shakeology.com/en_US/) has an answer to this question.

>Shakeology is so incredible, there's nothing out there that can supply you with the nutrients, vitamins, proteins, and minerals in these amounts the way one delicious shake can.

Is it just me? or did they complete dodge that question. If it's unclear, I'll fill in the gaps. It's a powdered shake mix. Now we're getting somewhere. But what makes shakeology special? Well they have some information about that to.

They claim that shakeology helps with

- Lose weight
- Reduce junk food cravings
- Provide healthy energy
- Support your digestion regularly

How does it accomplish all this?

Well reducing cravings for junk food and lose weight go hand in hand. Remember [CICO](/2016/06/23/chp1-secret/)? Well if you're eating less calorie dense junk food, you'll be reducing your calorie intake. Fair enough, but how does it reduce calorie cravings? It makes you feel full. Remember when I broke down [food](/2016/06/27/chp2-bit-food/)? Shakeology has 17g of protein and 6g of fiber to help you feel full. The healthy energy comes from 17g of carbohydrates (including 6g of sugar). Finally the digestion comes from prebiotics, the aforementioned fiber, and probiotics.

#### Can it be made with substitutes?

So with all this benefit, Shakeology seems pretty great. And at $129.95 for a 30 serving bag, sure seems worth it right? Just $4.33 a serving, less than the cost of a footlong at Subway. But can we, with a little effort, come up with a cost effective substitute? I think so. I'm putting up 1 scoop of Gold Standard Whey protein supplement, and a Meijer brand daily men's multivitamin. I can pick up 6lbs (~82 uses) of the whey protein at Costco for $60, and the Meijer multivitamin costs me $10.99 for 200 pills.

#### How they stack up

How do they break down? Well the full data is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BDN5rlscOjIf8Hqcyrk7KcyUBG3oFH8BzzR5sDaLrYw/edit?usp=sharing), but I'll break down the important stuff. Compared to Shakeology's 17g of protein and 160 calories, the alternate packs 24g of protein into only 120 calories. So far so good, Shakeology does have the advantage on sugar and fiber, but a teaspoon each of sugar and a fiber supplement could fill the gap if you really wanted it. On the vitamin breakdown the alternate has the edge, with more of 24 vitamins. Shakeology surpasses the alternate in 7, and they contain equal amounts of 3 vitamins. Seems like the alternate is a pretty good subsitute, if not better. But what about the cost. Well, compared to the $4.33/serving cost of Shakeology, the alternate costs a whopping... $0.73/serving.

#### Verdict.

So where do we stand? Is Shakeology worth it? Well value is subjective, so I can't make this call for anyone but me. So this is just my opinion but...

No. Not even a little bit.
