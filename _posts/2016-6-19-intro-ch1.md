title: How I lost it - Introduction
tags: sound-body weight-loss
---

As promised, here is the first part of my weight loss eBook, edited to make sense in the context of a blog. Originally this was supposed to be both the introduction and chapter one. I found the post to be very lengthy, and I never want any of my content to feel like a chore to get through. So I thought I'd just release smaller bits on a monday/thursday schedule instead of weekly. Additionally, other non-weight loss posts are on the way.

#### What's not in this blog

This might not be the diet blog you're looking for. This blog is not about eating the "right" food. It won't tell you how to boost your metabolism or cleanse your "toxins". This isn't a low-carb diet, high-fat diet, or vegan diet. It's technically not even a diet at all. As a quick google search will tell you, a diet is defined:

>The kinds of food that a person, animal, or community habitually eats.

Oh sure, after reading this blog, I hope you will be able to make smarter choices about what you eat, but that's not what this blog is about. This blog isn't a juice cleanse, or a weekend soup-fest that will drop eight pounds in three days. Nope. This blog is about how to make real lifestyle changes, that will shed real pounds, and keep them off for as long as you apply the principles described in it.

#### Why I wrote this blog

Losing weight made me believe in my other self improvement efforts. If I could achieve one goal, I could achieve others, like write a book (or in this case, a blog to eBook). So why this topic? Well as I was shopping for new books I passed the diet/nutrition section. I noticed they we're almost all bullshit. Titles like "Soup off 14 pounds in seven days" and "lose 10 pounds in 10 days with these negative calorie foods."

Maybe there was a reason those were the diet books that were on the shelf. Maybe nobody wants to spend money to learn the hard way to lose weight, no matter that it's the way to achieve lasting results. Maybe nobody is gonna read this blog. I don't care, I wanted to write a something, and I feel like this needed to be written.

#### What will I need to get started?

I've recently started embracing checklists in my life, and just in case you're like me, I wrote one up. Here's what you'll need to apply the principles described in this blog. Okay, some of them you don't *need*, you'll just really *really* want, but they should be mentioned.

##### Motivation

I was going to say discipline, and I make sure to note a careful distinction between the two, but I did call this section "What will I need to get started" and to get started you'll need motivation. Rest assured, you will need discipline to keep going, but for many people, myself included, applying the principles in this blog create a keystone habit, that actually helps build discipline.

##### A food log

Some way of recording what you eat. Yes, the method described in this blog requires that you record what you eat and drink. If that's not something you feel like doing, you don't want this blog. You want some other weightloss blog. It's probably on written by the same blog author promising financial success without paying attention to your income and expenses. There are many apps for this, MyFitnessPal, LoseIt, and many others. If you have a FitBit, their app will come with one, and others still are more old fashioned. In the end, any recording method will do. When I started, I used a notebook and a pencil. No, Honestly:

##### A digital kitchen scale

If you're anything like me, you get suspicious of any solution to any problem that demands you go out an buy something. To be factually correct, you don't absolutely need one, but many people who have used this method will agree with me here: A digital kitchen scale is one of the most useful pieces of hardware for precise food logging. If you're into baking, you probably already have one, because measuring flour by volume is just asking for inconsistent results. If you don't have one, this may very well become your favorite kitchen tool, and will pay for itself a thousand times over in reduced food costs, and more importantly, less medical expenses. At the time of writing, a decent one of these will only cost you $11 on amazon.

##### A support team

No man(or woman for that matter) is an island. This isn't "Weightloss: The easy way" and it's definitely not "Weightloss: The quick way." Nope. You will get tired. Your discipline will fail (That's fine by the way, that's how it grows). When you get down, you're going to need people to help you get back up and stick with your plan. The best people for this, are people that share similar goals, and preferably, are applying the same system. They don't need to be loved ones, or even friends. They can be coworkers, classmates or even strangers over the internet. I can't recommend any community more highly than [/r/loseit](http://reddit.com/r/loseit). It's frequented by fantastic people, who will help you get on track and stay on track. Most of the information in this blog I either learned there, or found from sources they recommended.
