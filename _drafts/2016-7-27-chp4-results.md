title: How I lost it - Chapter 4&#58; Seeing Results

So you've been weighing your oatmeal, and counting your slices of hand tossed pepperoni. What do you need to know about seeing results?

#### When should I weigh myself and how often

This depends entirely on your preference, but IMO there are two basic ways to approach this, and it depends on whether or not you pass the [marshmallow test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment). TL;DR: Somebody offers you a marshmallow, but offers you two if you can wait an hour. If you can wait for the extra mallow, you "Pass". If you go for the instant gratification... you um... well you fail, and IMHO you should work on that. If you can wait for the larger payoff then, counterintuitively, I would say feel free to weight yourself every day. Why? Well... because *weight loss is nonlinear*

What do I mean by that... to spare you a thousand words, here's a picture. The little ups and downs WILL happen, and if you've got the discipline to hold off for the extra marshmellow, then you probably have the discipline to stick with the plan, despite the emotional setback of seeing an extra two pounds on the scale occasionally, for like, no reason. However, if you have to constantly see forward progress, I'd suggest spacing out your weigh-ins, at least 2 weeks, to ride out the ups and downs.

#### What if the numbers go up

Well, this depends on how you approached the previous question. If you weigh yourself like I do every morning, post-pee and pre-shower, and the number goes up, Don't Panic. The goal is to lose fat, and weight is just this inaccurate measure of fat. For instance, it's quite easy to gain a pound of weight without gaining any fat. Don't believe me? Drink a pint of water.

If however, you weigh yourself once every two weeks, then still Don't Panic. At least not until it happens twice in a row. It's not uncommmon for weight to fluctuate as much as 3-5 lbs. Even at a 1000 calorie deficit, you could have lost 4 pounds of fat, but gained "weight". However, if it's been a month with little or not loss... then you might have hit a plateau.

#### Avoiding the weight plateau

Sometimes, you can be hitting your deficit, and for a week or two, not lose any weight. This can happen, and you may just have to ride it out. If you picked up a new workout routine, you could be retaining water. If there is a lot of sodium in your diet you can also be retaining water. However, it persists longer than a few weaks, well you could be maintaining, not cutting.

There is possibly a reasonable explaination for this. Remember when we calculated your TDEE based on your weight? Well if you don't weigh what you did then, then your TDEE won't be what it was then. General rule of thumb is to recalculate your TDEE every 10 lbs. If you're using a tracker, such as MyFitnessPal, then you can usually "Reset your goal", and it will take your new weight (if you've been recording it along with your food) and calculate a new TDEE.

Then there's the possibility that you're counting wrong. If this is the case, you need to go back and scrutinize every bit of your log. Are you weighing solids by volume? weighing cooked meat, but using pre-cooked nutritional information? Are you not logging everything you're eating?

I know you've heard stories about your friend who eats 5000 calories and doesn't gain weight, or a friend who only eats 1000 and struggles with their weight. Sadly these people are not special snowflakes, They are bad at math. It's hard truth time. Your food log, and your activity log are just tools to help you hit a caloric deficit. Your body is the real log. If the weight is not coming off, then you are not eating less than you burn. Wether you're wrong about calories in, or calories out, or both, somewhere you're slipping. Find the leak, and plug it.
